Image Classifier - using Inception V3 Architecture

The Dataset of 116 images was split as 96 for training and 20 for validation. 
After testing the images on classifier built using 3 different backbone architectures- 
      1. Vgg16 
      2. Inception V3
      3. Resnet50 
InceptionV3 was the choice of base architecture based on the Validation accuracy obtained. 

Model : The Inception V3 model was imported with all the top layers(FC) excluded. 
        The following layers were added on to convolutional layers of the inception V3 model. 
		1. Global Average Pooling Layer 
		2. Fully connected layer with 512 neurons
		3. Relu activation layer 
		4. Dropout Layer 
		5. Output layer with a sigmoid function
	The optimizer used was Adam and the loss was binary cross entropy. 

Result : The model was trained for 50 epochs with training accuracy at 89%.
	 The Validation accuracy over the epochs stagnanted between 0.5 and 0.65
	 
The low validation accuracy can be attributed to less number of images for classification of images (B and M) which are very similar.
