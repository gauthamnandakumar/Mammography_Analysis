Abnormality Detection and Classification using MaskRCNN

MaskRCNN can be used to perform instance segmentation.
For training the model it requires 3 inputs:
	1. Image
	2. Masks for each abnormality instance
	3. Class associated to each Mask [B or M]

The Masks for the training were obtained from the x,y co-ordinates 
and the radius info provided with the dataset. 
I build square boxes and constructed the mask. 

The dataset was divided as 98 images for training and 14 images for validation

The detection confidence was at 0.5

Please do look at the Jupyter Notebook attached to better understand the architecture and the results. 

The average IOU on the validation set is 0.64
The training Loss is at 0.32
