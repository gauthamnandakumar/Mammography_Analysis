I provide 2 solutions to analyze Mammograms. 
The first approach is to use the Vgg16 network and do a image classifier. 
But upon evaluating the results I observed that this model did not give good accuracy on the validation set. 
I decided to take an alternative approach. I used MaskRCNN

Advantages of MaskRCNN
 1. Localization
 2. Segmentation 
 3. classification

Since the MaskRCNN architecture provides 2 more added features I believed the model to provide me a good solution. 
And unlike the Vgg16 network , since the MaskRCNN uses Regional Proposal Network the chances of detecting the ABnormality is very high.
